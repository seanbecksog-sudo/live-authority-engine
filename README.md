# Live Authority: Human Presence Protocol

## The Problem
In an era of deepfakes and AI-driven identity theft, proving you are a REAL human at a REAL place at a REAL time is becoming impossible.

## The Solution
The Live Authority app acts as a 'Real-Time Bridge.' It generates a cryptographic proof of your existence using:
1. **Biometric Liveness:** Ensuring the user is biological, not digital.
2. **Temporal Locking:** Syncing with decentralized clocks to prove "Now."
3. **Geospatial Attestation:** Using encrypted GPS to prove "Here."

## Core Goal
To provide a 'Universal Reality Token' that can be used for voting, banking, and social media verification.
